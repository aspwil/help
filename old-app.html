    <h1>find old google playstore apps:</h1>
    ever been trying to find an old app you lost?<br>
    well i have a solution give you meet a few conditions:<br>
    - you installed it though the google playstore<br>
    - you still have access to the google account you installed it from
    <br><br>
    here is how:<br>
    - on a phone logged into the relevant google account go into the play store app<br>
    - click on the user icon in the top right<br>
    - click on "manage apps and devices"<br>
    - at the top click the tab labeled "Manage"<br>
    - in the first drop down menu at the top labeled "Installed" click it and set it to "Not Installed"<br><br>
    this will pull up a list of every app you have installed though that google account, that you don't currently have installed on the phone.<br><br>
    now the annoying part, you can sort by alphabetical, or by when you last had it installed, you cant search by name though.<br><br>
    now simply scroll though the list of possibly thousands of apps and see if you can find the one your looking for.<br><br>
    annoying, but it can work if your running out of other options.
